      "Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \\n\\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \\nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \\nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \\nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

      "This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe ❤️❤️ \n",

I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\\n\\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term. Not excepting all the answers from youtube comments but still 😂❤ \n",

      "dodie, i'm not exactly sure what i hope to gain out of writing you this message, as i'm sure you get tons of messages like this daily. i suppose its more so for me than for you, but i really want you to know what an impact you have had on me. i have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization since i was little, but recently after a car accident was launched into it basically 24/7 for a couple of months now. its truly the scariest thing i've ever had to deal with, and there have been so many times when i have felt so completely alone and ready to give up. just seeing that you also struggle with this and that you still manage to do so much and reach so many people, honestly that keeps me going sometimes. this disorder is truly one of the most devastating things in my opinion, but you are such a bright light. so thank you, for this and for being you ❤️ \n",

      "I've been dealing with dissociation and depersonalisation disorder for over a year now. I was scared to watch this video, because Dodie has always been my escape from everything. The world is so unfair for making her feel the same things and struggling with this condition the same way I and many people do. This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls 👏🏻💕 I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost. I don't know who I am, I only know who I once was. But that person in the past is not me anymore. I just wish everything would end and I found myself again. It will be over, but I'll always be asking when? \n",

      "Idek what's wrong with me if can't even form the words to make out what was wrong with me. It could be depression but I know for a fact I have anxiety I just don't know how severe. I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad. Bc I can't talk to anyone bc I can't explain what I feel. And jeez. Does anyone have any advice. I'm probably just rambling. My mind feels like mush like its in a haze of some sort. Idk pls help me someone. 😩😳😢 \n",

If you have this please could you give me some wise advice because I am very confused lol thanks! Also Dodie I hope you get better soon with your therapy help! I'm not going to give you my pity because I think that that's the worst thing someone can do when your going through something. You kind of just want them to go away😂 Thank you for sharing this video with us! It sure helped me and hopefully a lot of other people! I love you Dodie! x \n",

Hopefully this will help him understand more, if any of you have any advice please let me know 👌💕 \n",

The Disaster Artist is probably my favourite book of the 2010's thus far, however I find Seth Rogen and James Franco to be lack lister actors with the exception of Freaks & Geeks. Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.\\n\\nI will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie. 😉 \n",

I suppose that I take it as always being able to start over because you can always paint over your work on a canvas, change something to make it new, look at it from a different perspective. Or how from rock bottom, you can only go upwards. With a clean canvas, you can decide to paint the same thing again or something different and that freedom is the line between accepting as things are or trying to change.

      "Thanks for sharing this. I feel like your videos can really help a lot new moms and future moms. You talk about topics that really happens- the good, the bad, and the ugly! I'm a mom of two and my milk didn't come in until the 4th day for both of my babies. The second time around was much easier as I knew what to expect, but as a first time mom with my son it was so frustrating. He wound latch on properly, but I knew he wasn't getting much because he wasn't having enough wet and poopy diapers. Ultimately, I had to supplement with formula for a few days until he started gaining weight again. Breastfeeding isn't easy. It literally sucks the life out of you 😂. Would I do it all over again? Heck yeah! Knowing that I can produce milk to nourish my baby is such an amazing feeling! \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked hearing another mom's story on breastfeeding. I didn't breastfeed my first child because I wasn't producing enough. With my second child I was so determined to breastfeed her so I stuck with it no matter how tired and frustrated I got. I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her. But on the plus side I haven't had my period since I was pregnant (almost 2 years)  💁🏻 \n",

      "With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part 😆 \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen! Glad to hear you were able to successfully breast feed Aria for 1 year 🙂 \n",

      "+From Head To Toe Thank you so much for sharing your experience. You are so brave 😇 ! I am not a mom yet but I really admire your mindset about how breasts look.

      "Thank you for sharing your breastfeeding journey, Jen! ❤️ My daughter only breastfed for only 2 weeks because I don't have that much supply to really make her full. She will cries every now and then and I have to fed her formula. Until then, she doesn't want to feed from me anymore. I have suffer from mastitis too, and shit it's hurt. Felt like your boobs had been punched really hard. I would sit and cry every night while holding my breast. Now my daughter is 14 months and a healthy little human 💖 Your video will be my future reference! Love you! ❤️ \n",

      "I still remember how my first few days were hell as i had to go through painful moments where my nipples were sore and blistered and breasts so engorged with milk. But I never give up. I wanted to feel 'complete'. Plus my baby refused formula milk . I'm as petite as Jen only slightly bigger and taller and I still breastfeed my son who's turning 2 at the end of this month. Constantly I get people asking when will i stop breastfeeding him. My answer is when he wants to. He eats a good diet and does drink  milk like soy milk or almond milk every now and then. I've tried so hard when he was a baby to feed him formula but he just refused. I'm happy to breastfeed him. 😊 \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ❤️ \n",

I suppose that I take it as always being able to start over because you can always paint over your work on a canvas, change something to make it new, look at it from a different perspective. Or how from rock bottom, you can only go upwards. With a clean canvas, you can decide to paint the same thing again or something different and that freedom is the line between accepting as things are or trying to change.

      "Thanks for sharing this. I feel like your videos can really help a lot new moms and future moms. You talk about topics that really happens- the good, the bad, and the ugly! I'm a mom of two and my milk didn't come in until the 4th day for both of my babies. The second time around was much easier as I knew what to expect, but as a first time mom with my son it was so frustrating. He wound latch on properly, but I knew he wasn't getting much because he wasn't having enough wet and poopy diapers. Ultimately, I had to supplement with formula for a few days until he started gaining weight again. Breastfeeding isn't easy. It literally sucks the life out of you 😂. Would I do it all over again? Heck yeah! Knowing that I can produce milk to nourish my baby is such an amazing feeling! \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked hearing another mom's story on breastfeeding. I didn't breastfeed my first child because I wasn't producing enough. With my second child I was so determined to breastfeed her so I stuck with it no matter how tired and frustrated I got. I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her. But on the plus side I haven't had my period since I was pregnant (almost 2 years)  💁🏻 \n",

      "\n",
      "With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part 😆 \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen! Glad to hear you were able to successfully breast feed Aria for 1 year 🙂 \n",

      "+From Head To Toe Thank you so much for sharing your experience. You are so brave 😇 ! I am not a mom yet but I really admire your mindset about how breasts look.

      "Thank you for sharing your breastfeeding journey, Jen! ❤️ My daughter only breastfed for only 2 weeks because I don't have that much supply to really make her full. She will cries every now and then and I have to fed her formula. Until then, she doesn't want to feed from me anymore. I have suffer from mastitis too, and shit it's hurt. Felt like your boobs had been punched really hard. I would sit and cry every night while holding my breast. Now my daughter is 14 months and a healthy little human 💖 Your video will be my future reference! Love you! ❤️ \n",

      "I still remember how my first few days were hell as i had to go through painful moments where my nipples were sore and blistered and breasts so engorged with milk. But I never give up. I wanted to feel 'complete'. Plus my baby refused formula milk . I'm as petite as Jen only slightly bigger and taller and I still breastfeed my son who's turning 2 at the end of this month. Constantly I get people asking when will i stop breastfeeding him. My answer is when he wants to. He eats a good diet and does drink  milk like soy milk or almond milk every now and then. I've tried so hard when he was a baby to feed him formula but he just refused. I'm happy to breastfeed him. 😊 \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ❤️ \n",

      "A year or two ago I listened to the song Mansion for the first time. I learned all the words and everything, but for some reason I never checked out any of Nathan's other songs or took in the lyrics even though they were so meaningful. But when I finally knew what it felt like to feel depressed and suicidal, I was chilling outside trying to find a way to cope with all of the pain, and that's when I found Logic's 1-800 song I was blown away. I looked at the comments of that video (it was the audio not the music video) and found somebody saying that if they liked logic than they would definitely like NF - Therapy Session. Me being curious I checked him out not even realizing I had a couple of songs by him already. Therapy Session was the song that made me fall in love with NF and his music. He has helped me so much, and is the reason I have chose to keep going. I'm not out of my bad place and I don't think I will be ok for a long time, but when I need an escape Nathan is here for me like he is with many others. I love being able to cry out to his songs because I know that he feels the same pain I'm feeling and to be honest I'm tearing up a little now. I love you Nathan. Thank you for keeping me alive 💙 \n",

For those complaining about it being an empty shell with a roll cage, yeah well that's still a sedan, and their point here isn't to break a record of a street legal car. I assume the goal was to break the record of a Sedan body car, at all costs. Hence the 600 ponies, nearly double that of a factory STi. I say job well done.

      "Jen, you made me cry, laugh and then cry again. As a breastfeeding mom of an 11-month old, everything you just said was so accurate and relatable. My goal is to breastfeed my son until he's two so i'm not stopping anytime soon. It's the most exhausting yet most satisfying thing I've ever done. Kudos to all the mommies out there who already made it and congratulations to you Jen for making it this far. You are an inspiration. ❤️ \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked hearing another mom's story on breastfeeding. I didn't breastfeed my first child because I wasn't producing enough. With my second child I was so determined to breastfeed her so I stuck with it no matter how tired and frustrated I got. I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her. But on the plus side I haven't had my period since I was pregnant (almost 2 years)  💁🏻 \n",

      "\n",
      "With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part 😆 \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen! Glad to hear you were able to successfully breast feed Aria for 1 year 🙂 \n",
      "\n",
      "+From Head To Toe Thank you so much for sharing your experience. You are so brave 😇 ! I am not a mom yet but I really admire your mindset about how breasts look. As a small chested lady I always get shy and unconfident whenever I look at my small chest. Thank you for giving me the motivation and confidence to make peace with the breasts 😊😊 \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for sharing your breastfeeding journey, Jen! ❤️ My daughter only breastfed for only 2 weeks because I don't have that much supply to really make her full. She will cries every now and then and I have to fed her formula. Until then, she doesn't want to feed from me anymore. I have suffer from mastitis too, and shit it's hurt. Felt like your boobs had been punched really hard. I would sit and cry every night while holding my breast. Now my daughter is 14 months and a healthy little human 💖 Your video will be my future reference! Love you! ❤️ \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ❤️ \n",

Every phone has extra features, but after one week we realise that they are useless. Face unlock is not new for me, my phone in 2010 had this feature, Sony Ericsson Neo V. Considering the size of the screen, some will say that iPhone 5s has a very small display, it's not 1080p, etc. If you remember some years ago, small displays were a trend, now bigger displays are, but I prefer to buy what is better for me, and not for the other's eyes. Colour accuracy, or resolution doesn't matter to me cuz my gaming PC has a 4k display. To sum up, in advertisements everything looks good, if you are dump you buy everything, if you are not, you think what you already have, and if those extra features worth 1000+ euros. \n",
